# **Feature Specification: Multi-Window Event System**

## **Feature Overview**

This feature establishes a real-time synchronization system between multiple browser windows using **LocalStorage** as the communication layer. It enables dynamic particle interactions across windows by tracking their positions, states (open/close), and dimensions (resize). The system ensures seamless connectivity and responsiveness, allowing for scalable and visually coherent multi-window experiences.

## **User Stories**

- **As a user**, I want to open new windows so that they automatically join the particle interaction network.
- **As a user**, I want to move or resize windows so that particles adjust dynamically to their new positions and sizes.
- **As a user**, I want to close windows so that they are cleanly removed from the particle system without errors.
- **As a power user**, I want to perform rapid window changes (open/move/close) so that the system remains stable and responsive.

## **Acceptance Criteria**

- The system registers new windows via **LocalStorage events**, with updates propagating in **<200ms**.
- Each window is assigned a **unique ID (UUID)** and tracked in a shared state:
- Window movements/resizes are **debounced (100-200ms)** to optimize performance.
- Closed windows are **deregistered automatically**
